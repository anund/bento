# Usage

- `bento init`
  - create the layout for bento in the current directory (only work from flakes)

- `bento deploy`
  - build configurations and deploy configuration files, requires to be root.

- `bento diff`
  - display the difference between each remote system version and their new version. Supports `NAME` environment variable.

- `bento build [dry-run|build|test|switch]`
  - dry-build or build configurations. Using `test` or `switch`, can be used to apply a configuration locally. Default is `build`.
  - when using `TARGET_IP`, the command is run on a remote server

- `bento status`
  - display information for remote hosts
  - if the command is run in interactive mode, `bento` will run in an inifite loop the status display and wait for a change in the chroot directory
  - if the command isn't run in interactive mode, the status is only displayed once and `bento` exits

- `bento flake-update [input]`
  - recursively update flakes lock files
  - with [input] parameter it only update the input passed as parameter

- `env NAME=someconfig bento deploy|build`
  - only build / deploy the system "someconfig"

# Configuration file

A local file `config.sh` is required for Bento, it contains variable used to generate the scripts:

- `CHROOT_DIR`: the directory in which the SFTP server will be configured to serve files from
- `REMOTE_IP`: the IP address or hostname used by SFTP client to reach the server with the configuration files
- `REMOTE_PORT`: the port of the IP address or hostname used by SFTP client to reach the server with the configuration files. Defaults to 22.
- `TIMEOUT`: time in seconds to wait until aborting when connecting to the SFTP server. Default value is `20` seconds.

# Environment variables

`bento` is using the following environment variables as configuration:
- `BENTO_DIR`: contains the path of a bento directory, so you can run `bento` commands from anywhere
- `NAME`: contains machine names (flake config or directory in `hosts/`) to restrict commands `deploy`, `diff` and `build` to this machine only
- `VERBOSE`: if defined to anything, display `nixos-rebuild` output for local builds done with `bento build` or `bento deploy`
- `TARGET_IP`: can be used to push a configuration closure to a remote system, it's wrapping `nixos-rebuild`. Only work with `bento build [switch|test]`.
- `NIX_SSHOPTS`: parameters for ssh to be used when `TARGET_IP` is used. Example: `NIX_SSHOPTS=-p2222` to use port 2222 instead of the standard port 22.

# Self update mode

You can create a file named `SELF_UPDATE` in a host directory using flakes. When that host will look for updates on the sftp server, if there is no changes to rebuild, if `SELF_UPDATE` exists along with a `flake.nix` file, it will try to update the inputs, if an input is updated, then the usual rebuild is happening.

This is useful if you want to let remote hosts to be autonomous and pick up new nixpkgs version as soon as possible.

Systems will be reported as "auto upgraded" in the `bento status` command if they rebuild after a local flake update.

This adds at least 8 kB of inbound bandwidth for each input when checking for changes.

# Auto reboot

You can create a file named `REBOOT` in a host directory.  When that host will rebuild the system, it will look at the new kernel, kernel modules and initrd, if they changed, a reboot will occur immediately after reporting a successful upgrade.  A kexec is used for UEFI systems for a faster reboot (this avoids BIOS and bootloader steps).

Independently of the `REBOOT` file, in the provided `utils/bento.nix`, there is a systemd service that can be enabled to automatically reboot at a given systemd calendar if the kernel/mdoules/initrd changed.  This is more convenient for servers.

# Status report of the fleet

Use `bento status` to get a report of your fleet, all information are extracted from the logs files deposited after each update:

- what is the version they should have (built locally) against the version they are currently running
- their current state
- the time elapsed since last rebuild
- the time elapsed since the new onfiguration has been made available

Non-flakes systems aren't reproducible (without efforts), so we can't compare the remote version with the local one, but we can report this information.

Example of output:

```
   machine   local version   remote version              state                                     time

# Status list

- **sync pending**: no configuration file changed, only files specific to **Bento** changed
- **rebuild pending**: the local version has been updated and remote will need to run `nixos-rebuild`
- **up to date**: no difference between the local configuration and what the remote system is running
- **extra logs**: the update process has been run more than once, this shouldn't happen. The most common case is that the update service has been started again manually.
- **failing**: the update process failed
- **rollbacked**: the update process failed, but a rollback has been done to previous version. **Bento** won't try to update until a new configuration is available.
